   <h2>Review</h2>
   <p>I feel that this movie was great as it featured magic and many different species of animals known as ‘’Beasts’’ in it. As i love magic, this movie is definitely my kind. I also find it extremely interesting to see those new animals and the different powers or abilities they have. The most interesting animal i saw was the little black-coloured pig nosed rat. It was cute and funny, i also learnt that it loved gold coloured items and always goes missing just because he wants to get them. The story had many parts that was heart warming and touching. The ending was also sad as the people had to leave and separate. After all, I think that the movie was extremely fantastic and i will definitely recommend those that have not watched it yet to watch it.</p>
   <h2>Interests</h2>
   <p>I like to play computer games and also table tennis as computer games help me relief stress when there are to much homework or tests while table tennis allows me to bond with my friends.
   <h2>Projects</h2>
